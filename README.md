# Youtube Music Lyrics button

This is a chrome extension that adds a button to the bottom bar of the youtube music player.
This button, when pressed, attempts to open the [genius](https://genius.com) page for the currently-playing song.
Obviously, this isn't perfect -- if the song isn't on genius, the button will still open the genius page.
